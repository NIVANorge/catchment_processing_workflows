    "**Note:** The defaults in `pysheds.resolve_flats()` for `max_iter` and `eps` are 1000 and 1e-5, respectively. This caused strange results, where applying `resolve_flats` would fail to resolve all flats, and would also introduce additional pits, leading to very poor catchment delineation. The defaults seem to be appropriate only for fairly small areas (i.e. not that many grid cells). Setting `max_iter` to be very large and `eps` to be very small seems to resolve the problem, without too much additional overhead. See [here](https://github.com/mdbartos/pysheds/issues/188) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** Some PySheds functions give strange output with irregularly DEMs containing NoData (e.g. non-rectangular datasets with NoData cells around the margins). Best results seem to be achieved by filling all NoData cells with valid low values. In particular, if no stream burning is being performed, set all NoData values and values less than zero to zero. Alternatively, if stream burning is included, set all NoData values and values less than zero to `-dz` (i.e. the stream burn depth). This essentially creates DEMs with large, low flat areas around the margins, which forces all cells to drain to them eventually."
